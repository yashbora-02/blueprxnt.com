            <p class="about-intro">I wasn't always fit, confident, or comfortable in my own body. As a first-generation Indian-American, I grew up overweight, struggling with self-esteem, and constantly comparing myself to others. No matter how hard I trained or how disciplined I tried to be, my "skinny-fat" build and genetics always seemed to hold me back. I was strong, but not lean. Active, but not truly healthy. The gap between where I was and where I wanted to be—physically, mentally, and socially—stuck with me for years.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Growing Up Indian in America</h2>
            <p class="section-text">Sports were my passion, but I rarely saw anyone who looked like me succeed at the highest level. Professional athletics weren't in the cards, so I chose a different path: coaching. I earned two performance degrees from Kansas State University and worked my way into elite environments—Michigan State, the University of Oregon (competing for a National Championship), and the New York Giants in the NFL. What set me apart wasn't just credentials. It was my drive to see the whole system, not just the parts, and to challenge conventional thinking long before it was mainstream.</p>

            <p class="section-text">Working at the highest levels of sport taught me what most people never see: everyone adapts differently, and true performance only lasts when it's built on a foundation of health.</p>
            <p class="section-bold">Genetics, lifestyle, stress, and reality all matter.</p>
            <p class="section-text">That insight pushed me to blend health and performance into a single, integrated system.</p>

            <p class="section-text">Despite all my incredible success working in elite sport, the knowledge I had accumulated, and the position I was in—I felt like a fraud. I wasn't living it. In 2019, after accepting an alumni award, I found myself alone in a hotel room, 225 pounds and 30% body fat—strong, but metabolically unhealthy. I had become something I never thought I would nor wanted to—another unhealthy Indian, adding to the statistics.</p>
