# System Page - Exact Match to Screenshots

## ✅ All Sections Updated to Match Original Site

The system page has been completely updated to match the screenshots pixel-perfectly.

### Changes Made:

## 1. **The Five Domains Section** ✅
**BEFORE:** Had icons and different text structure
**NOW:** Matches screenshot exactly:
- Numbered format (1., 2., 3., 4., 5.) without icons
- Title + main description + gray subtitle for each
- Content: "The Blueprxnt System is built across five integrated areas:"
- 1. Intake - "Nutrition, hydration, and supplementation — everything entering your system" / "Built for your physiology, culture, and lifestyle"
- 2. Physical Activity - "Training, daily movement, and mobility" / "Designed to build capacity without unnecessary fatigue"
- 3. Recovery - "Sleep, stress regulation, and nervous system balance" / "Where adaptation and progress actually happen"
- 4. Environment - "Your exposure landscape — home, work, social life, travel, routines, light, toxins, stress" / "Designed to make execution easier, not harder"
- 5. Inner Self - "Mindset, identity, emotional regulation, and behavior patterns" / "The foundation of consistency"
- Closing: "These aren't separate. They function as one integrated system."

## 2. **How the System Is Sequenced** ✅
**BEFORE:** Long descriptions with multiple bullet points
**NOW:** Matches screenshot exactly:
- Intro: "Just like elite athletes, not everything is optimized at once."
- Phase 1 Fundamentals: "Intake • Physical Activity • Recovery" with 3 bullets (Stabilize energy, Restore capacity, Build momentum)
- Phase 2 Context: "Environment" with 3 bullets (Reduce friction, Design routines, Make progress automatic)
- Phase 3 Identity: "Inner Self" with single text: "Health becomes who you are — not something you try to do"
- Removed bottom note text

## 3. **How We Assess & Interpret Health** ✅
**BEFORE:** Different content structure
**NOW:** Matches screenshot exactly:
- Intro: "Just like in elite sport, we look at both the internal system and external performance."
- Internal Health (under the hood):
  - Bloodwork and metabolic markers
  - Hormones, inflammation, recovery capacity
  - Genetics and response tendencies
- External Performance (real life output):
  - Energy, focus, stress tolerance
  - Sleep quality and recovery trends
  - Body composition (DEXA)
  - Strength, fitness, movement, mobility
- Quote box with 4 lines:
  - "We don't chase numbers in isolation."
  - "Every metric is interpreted within your lifestyle, goals, workload, and recovery capacity."
  - "Data without context is noise." (gray text)
  - "Context turns data into progress." (bold)

## 4. **Genetics & Individualization Matter** ✅
**BEFORE:** Caffeine metabolism example
**NOW:** Matches screenshot exactly:
- "Not everyone adapts the same way."
- "Genetics, ethnicity, training history, lifestyle, and stress load shape what works."
- Example box: "South Asians develop insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease at far lower body weights than other populations. Generic plans often fail them."
- Closing: "Blueprxnt is built around you — not templates."

## 5. **Building Progress That Lasts** ✅
**BEFORE:** 4-step flow diagram with Assess, Intervene, Monitor, Adapt
**NOW:** Matches screenshot exactly:
- Blue statement: "You don't earn optimization until fundamentals are solid."
- "The first priority is building habits that stick:"
- Box: "New → Familiar → Routine → Automatic → Adaptable"
- "Once the foundation is stable, we layer performance:"
- Box: "Foundation → Capacity → Performance → Longevity"
- "No cycles. No resets."
- "The system evolves as your life evolves."
- "This is how progress compounds."

## 6. **Where This Leads** ✅
**BEFORE:** Different card descriptions
**NOW:** Matches screenshot exactly:
- Intro: "Blueprxnt gives you:"
- 4 cards with:
  - Clarity - "instead of confusion"
  - Structure - "instead of guesswork"
  - Capacity - "instead of burnout"
